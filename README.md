# DayPlannerForYou
## Description
We have created a day planner for our current day. It shows the date at the top, and it will highlight the time of day you are at in red. The past will be in grey and the future will be in green. It also keeps your inputs in local storage, so as you refresh the page, the comments will stay.

# Usage
Here is the title of the page displaying the current date

And here is the place where you put in your info. The left side is the time of day, the middle is your text area, and the right is the button to save.
